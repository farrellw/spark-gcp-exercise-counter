It’s easy to be focused on the stress in your own life and have it weigh you down (parallels with a ruck) but your fellow brothers are out there dealing with their own stressors as well. It’s always good to be reminded to “pick up the six” and uplift each other in prayer or in deed.\n\nAmong our trek today we talked about a wide range of topics from family, work life, to less complicated topics such as the aerodynamics of a truck!\nStopping every 15 mins to do some reps:\nSquats:25\nPushups:25\nCurls:30 ( we did these and we enjoyed the nice view of the sunrise over Cottleville)\nThrusters:25\nBent over rows:30\nLunge walk between some telephone poles\nAnd finished with an up hill bear crawl\n\n",
